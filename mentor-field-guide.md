####Our Learning Philosophy Here at Thinkful 
We are laser-focused on student success. Other companies focus on producing content; we’re fans of them, and even use their content, but we’re in a different business. We don’t want to produce learning materials, we want to produce *learning*. We’re not satisfied with people buying our courses; we expect to provide the optimal conditions for them to actually learn. Below is our official Learning Philosophy -- the guiding principles that drive all of our educational decisions.

1. Real learning is fundamentally human.

2. Real learning happens when education is relevant to students’ interests and project-based.

3. Real learning is self-initiated but community supported.

<!---
	It would be nice to add a quick line or two about how these goals and our model our founded on strong mentorship. This is the first "official" looking text (not from an email) we send to mentors and possible a good place to underscore just how important they are to what we do.

	"students' interestes" = "...goals"?

We may be updating the when and what, and how of the first mentor session. 

	What, if anything, would we like the mentor to do in advance of the first session? Email student? Host a short mentor session before that. 

This session is also based on a 30-minute session - do we want to include a note for where to put the extra 15 minutes in other courses?

####Anatomy of a First Mentor Session

<!-- The headings below aren't constructed in parallel. Each sub-heading should either be a noun ("Goal Breakdown") or an instruction ("State Your Purpose")
	-->

**State Your Purpose and Agenda**

Get right down to business. Exude energy and a sense of urgency. (<1 minute)

**Socratic Seminar**

You will lean more psychologist than educator for this first session. Ask your student about her backstory, motivations, and dreams. (<20 minutes)

**Goal Breakdown**

Paint a vivid picture of the path your student must take to get from where she is now to where she wants to be -- emphasizing where Thinkful fits within that journey. (<4 minutes)

**Set High Expectations and Routines**

This is your pep talk. Firmly express what your student needs to do -- how much they have to commit -- to ultimately reach their goal. (<4 minutes)

**Closing End of Session**

That’s all folks! (Remember to close by setting the weekly SPRINT Goal with your student!)

####8 Tips on How to Have a Badass First Mentor Session

Below are 8 tips on how to make an incredible first impression that will inspire your students.

**1 | Skip the small talk**

Just do it. It’s awkward, wastes time, and doesn’t accomplish much.

**2 | Follow the 66.667% Rule**

About 2/3rds or 66.667% of the session should consist of the *student* speaking (20-30 minutes). This keeps the student engaged, and gives you the opportunity to show that you care about her goals. This foundation of care is essential to build the rapport necessary for true learning. To keep meaningful conversation going, have core questions and clarifying questions prepared. You can find a list of awesome clarifying questions in Chapter 6.

**3 | Be a Mickey Goldmill**

Our students are not learning to program just for the hell of it -- they’re learning because it will enable a dream. They want to work for themselves and and have more time to travel, work at an interesting startup with an ambitious mission, or simply make more money. Whatever the dream is, you want to know it. Use your Jedi questioning skills to draw this information out, and then validate that dream. Supporting your student will have a huge, positive impact on her learning, but only if the student follows up with committed skill building.

**5 | Work With Students to Break Their “Dream” Down to Measurable, Specific “Objectives”**

<!---
	Shorter objective?
-->

An ambiguous dream like “finding a job at a startup” is not helpful. The skills your student will need to demonstrate to get ahead are made up of sub-skills and objectives. Help your student create a clear, measurable path to achieving her dream. In this phase, it's essential that you share how your student's work with Thinkful fits within her journey to achieving her dream. More often than not, Thinkful is an early step towards building the foundational skills she needs to navigate the path on her own . 

**6 | Set Ambitious and Achievable Goals**

No matter how motivated students are, what courses they take, or how much they pay, students will not be able to achieve their goals unless they create the conditions for rigorous learning.

	This paragraph needs work.

Here are a some things you may find yourself telling students:

* You (the student) need to honestly invest enough time. 12 hours a week is our minimum. If you can’t invest 12 hours each week, you may find yourself unsatisfied with your progress.
* Block time off in your calendar immediately. Shift things around, speak to family and friends and set the expectation with them that you are going to be committed to learning this for the next 3 months.
* Find a consistent learning environment that works for you. It may be a coffee shop or the kitchen table. Have it be consistent and free of inhibiting distractions.
* See if a friend is willing to learn with you. Having an accountability partner will greatly enhance the chances of you learning this stuff. We offer an incentive for this as well.
* Attend Office Hours. In supplement to your mentor session, you can connect with mentors during the additional 12 open office hours offered each week.
* Engagein the Slack community. Getting quick feedback on projects is critical. Read through and critique other students’ code. Understanding a codebase someone else wrote is a valuable skill.
* Each week, no matter what, fill out your RECAP form.

**7 | Routine and Procedure are Your Best Friends**

Set routines and procedures from Day 1.

It would be GREAT if we had all the time in the world to create mind-blowingly fun mentor session plans for each of our students. The reality is that most of us have little to no time to prepare for each session. Instead, we rely on our accumulated experience to get us through.

Routine remedies this! By having an established procedure for running the mentor session, your student engages with a high quality session every single time without you thinking too much about it. Review our suggested weekly routine for you and students [HERE] and make sure to firmly set these routine into motion from the first session.

You only need two sentences to introduce your background. You’d be surprised how quickly students will pick it up from there with questions.

￼1. Mentor Session: Set Sprint Goal
Mentor sessions are 30 minutes, once a week per student. At the end of each session its important that you set a Weekly Sprint Goal -- a short term goal that the student is expected to accomplish in the upcoming week.
2. CRM
Immediately after each session, fill out your students’ CRM. This allows you to keep record on your students’ progress and allows us to keep track of everyone’s progress.
3. Send Follow Up E-mail
After each session, be sure to write a quick follow up e-mail summarizing what was covered in the session and clearly stating the Sprint Goal.


4. Engage in Google+ Community with other students
Sometime in the middle of the week, take time to explore our student Google+ communities and engage students with any questions they may have. Its also a great place to provide feedback on student projects.

5. Send Session & RECAP Form reminder
In GMAIL, automate an e-mail one day before each session requesting students to send in their e-mail and their

####The Socratic Method and 6 Other Awesome Coaching Strategies
**1 | Indirect Praise**

Less effective mentors sometime believe that excessive, direct praise like, “wow, you did an amazing job” or “you are so good at this” will increase student outcomes. The opposite is true.
These types of value judgements transform a coaching session into a time of evaluation and over time students become insensitive to the praise. Instead, provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the student's sufficient tackling of the problem. The student will deduce the praise themselves! Save direct positive feedback for those really, really special times.

**2 | Indirect Negative Feedback**

Avoid ever explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keep working backward until they are able to self-correct.

**3 | Scaffolding Questions**

There are different levels of questions. Lower level questions are easier and have clear, right or wrong answers. Higher level questions are harder and involve application of a variety of concepts within a real world setting. The “Scaffolding Questions” technique uses low level questions to build up to higher level questions. Many mentors fall into the trap of preserving student self esteem by dumbing down questions and never challenging students adequately or asking higher level questions too early in a session, which leavesstudents confused.

**4 | Code tour**

Many students can make something that works without understanding *why* it works. Asking them to “walkthrough” the code, explaining what each line does, allows them to recognize the “why” behind each action.

**5 | Teach the Teacher**

Teaching is sometimes the best way to learn. Have the student teach you a concept that they learned the prior week. This will be great reinforcement and will uncover learning gaps.

**6 | Awesome Analogies**

Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and fields, the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it!

<!---
	Link to some other cool analogies? Just list some?

**7 | Socratic Method**

The Socratic Method is a combination of all of the strategies above. The official definition is, “A pedagogical technique in which a teacher does not give information directly but instead asks a series of questions, with the result that the student comes either to the desired knowledge by answering the questions or to a deeper awareness of the limits of knowledge.” A teacher accomplishes this by integrating all of the techniques above to achieve a clear learning goal.

####Emergency Mentor Moments -- What to do During Extra Tough Mentor Situations

**My student wants to skip this week's session.**

Before anything else, use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors becomes more essential for students. You can ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared or lure them by sharing information that requires no preparation (like introducing developer tools). Do whatever you can to make that meeting happen. When you do have the meeting, simply follow your routine.
More broadly, begin to engrain in your student that your sole existence is to help them get out of tough situations. Don’t let them run away from hard parts of the curriculum — the benefits of learning to program are totally worth it. If they claim that the issue is external and that they are too busy, remind them of your belief in them. This may be the time to break the rules and provide strong, DIRECT feedback.

<!---
	Good content, but needs some reworking towards the end. "Sole existence" is a bit extreme
-->

**My student didn't do any work this week. At all.**

Use scaffolding and the Socratic Method to work with student on their current spot in the course. There will be times where you may have to teach a concept explicitly.

**My student is continually missing sessions.**

If students repeatedly refuse to meet let us know as soon as possible. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better support them and help them remember their commitment and goals. 

**What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?**

Hmmm. It depends. From our experience, the course material is foundational for building more advanced skills. The concepts that students often want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content if they wish to excel. 
Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it.
If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong grasp of the concept to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.
