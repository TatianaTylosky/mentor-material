##Chapter 1
####Welcome to Thinkful!
We are laser-focused on student success. Other companies focus on producing content; we’re fans of them, and even use their content, but we’re in a different business. We don’t want to produce learning materials, we want to produce *learning*. We’re not satisfied with people buying our courses; we expect to provide the optimal conditions for them to actually learn. At Thinkful, these conditions are based on three core pillars:


1. One-on-one mentorship

2. Active student community

3. Exceptional course content


To keep our students engaged and excited to learn, our courses are project-driven. Lessons begin with projects that guide this learning. A project-driven structure allows students to learn from real-world experiences, draw connections to those experiences, and internalize new ideas. No boring lectures. No endless chunks of text. As a mentor, you are an essential ingredient for the success of both your students and our mission, and we couldn’t be happier to have you on the team. Welcome to Thinkful!



##Chapter XXX
####Mentorship Behind the Scenes

Here is a brief overview of the tools you will be using as a Thinkful Mentor
Gmail - you have been setup with an @thinkful.com email address. Please use this address to communicate with your students and Thinkful HQ - feel free to forward messages to your regular email if you’d like!
Slack - Slack is our community portal for both mentors and students. We have two different “teams” on slack - one for students, and another for mentors/staff (thinkful-students.slack.com vs. thinkful.slack.com). You can think of these as the student lounge and the faculty lounge. As a mentor, you’ll have access to both. Feel free to use this tool as much or as little as you would like, and keep in mind that it’s a great place to meet other mentors and ask questions about the mentoring process. It’s also a great place to promote your side projects and meet awesome developers from all over the world!
Mentor Panel (thinkful.com/patel/mentor_panel)- This is your home page at Thinkful. From your mentor panel, you can:
Set and update your availability (keep an eye on the timezone!)
Adjust the number of students you would like to mentor
Find all of your students, their courses, and your meeting times/days
Record all of your session notes
It is extremely important that you record session notes after every session. These notes help us keep track of student progress and make sure students’ needs are being met. If a student doesn’t show up for a session, be sure to log “Session did not occur” in your notes for the week. 
Video Chat (Google Hangouts, TokBox, Skype, or your prefered tool) - you will be meeting with your student each week at the same time using your favorite video chat tool. Please make sure both you and your student test this tool before your first session - there’s nothing more frustrating than excitement devolving into frustration when it takes forever to connect due to technical reasons. Be sure to *over* communicate to your students when and how you will be meeting, and be sure to show up at least 5 minutes before your session. 

When you are first matched with a student, you will receive an email from our student support team introducing you to your mentee. It’s a great practice to write the student directly to both introduce yourself and set the tone for your sessions. Be brief, be funny, be awesome. Ask your student if they have any questions before your first session, and let them know you’re excited to be working with them!



##Chapter 2
####Your First Session

**Before Your First Session**
Prior to meeting with a student for the first time, please take a few steps to ensure you’re ready to be the best mentor they could have hoped for. These steps include:
An email sent before the session that introduces you, a bit of your work, and asks the student if they have any questions ahead of your initial meeting
Checking to make sure your video chat platform is working. Be sure to check both the camera and the microphone!
Familiarizing yourself with the curriculum 
As a mentor, we don’t expect you to read every word of every course you’re mentoring. However, it is important to take a look at the concepts and goals introduced at each step during the course. Please take some time to understand what’s being asked of your students so you can be in the best position to anticipate their questions or pain points. 
Prepare clarifying questions 
Whether or not the student has specific questions for you, you should have a list of questions prepared for your student. These questions should be comprehension checks for material covered in the first several lessons of the course. 
Be online at least 5 minutes before your session. 

**During Your First Session**

Skip the small talk! You’ve already introduced yourself via email, and getting right down to business will be less awkward and demonstrate to your student how much you care about her coding journey. 

The first session is a great time to learn a bit more about your student - what are her past experiences and future goals? Every student comes to Thinkful with some goal in mind, and you want to know what it is! Spend a few minutes getting to know what programming experience your student has (if any!) and how Thinkful will help them reach their next goal. 

Once you have learned about your student’s goals, it’s time to get right to it! Begin discussing the course material with the student, and start to gauge how enthusiastic they are about learning these new skills. Be sure to let your student do most of the talking - remember, this isn’t a lecture. Ask questions about concepts your student has covered and listen for comprehension. We will discuss specific tips and tricks for hosting a kickass session in the next chapter. 

Be sure to close your session by reminding your student how much you look forward to working with them for the next three months, and letting them know the best way to get in touch with you if they have questions before you meet again. Finally, set a specific goal for your student to achieve by your next meeting - every session should end with setting this goal, and all future sessions should begin by reviewing the previous week’s goal. 

**After The Session**

Be sure to visit the Mentor Panel and fill out your session notes for the meeting! This should only take 2-3 minutes, but is an essential way for you, and for us, to keep track of your student’s progress. Remember, students will never have access to these notes, so feel free to be be honest about their level of engagement and their progress. 

Two to three days after your session, it’s a great habit to send your student a short email reminding them what you covered in your last meeting and what they are working on for the next week. It’s a helpful reminder to them of what they should be doing, and more importantly, that you care about their progress. 

Congrats! You’ve now made it through your first mentor session and are well on your way to becoming a Thinkful Ninja (Thinja?). Remember, you can always reach out to the Thinkful HQ mentor team if you have any questions or issues.

##Chapter 3
####The Socratic Method and XXX Other Awesome Coaching Strategies

Every student has a different learning style, and no two sessions will be exactly the same. Sometimes, your student will come prepared with a list of questions and difficult concepts. Othertimes, they will simply show up and expect you to drive the session. By familiariaizng yourself with some of the strategies below, and using the right ones at the right times, you will ensure that every minute spent with your student is helping them with their work. 


**Teach a Man to Fish**

Many cultures have a saying along the lines of, “If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day. If you teach a man to fish, he will eat for life.” This concept is a perfect analogy for mentorship. If you simply answer every question a student poses, they will never learn how to find answers on their own. Instead, help them learn how to use Google, Stack Overflow, documentation, and other resources to get their questions answered when you’re not around. 

**Scaffolding Questions**

There are different levels of questions. Lower level questions are easier and have clear, right or wrong answers (e.g. “When do we use the <head> tag?”). Higher level questions are harder and involve application of a variety of concepts within a real world setting (e.g. “What’s the best way to display our menu bar?”). The “Scaffolding Questions” technique uses low level questions to build up to higher level questions. Many mentors fall into the trap of either a) preserving student self esteem by dumbing down questions and never challenging students adequately, or b) asking higher level questions too early in a session and leaving students confused. By asking questions that start simple and become more complex, you will help your student develop critical thinking skills and learn how to work through tough problems on their own. 


**Code Tour**

Many students can make something that works without understanding *why* it works. Asking them to “walkthrough” the code, explaining what each line does, allows them to recognize the “why” behind each action. Be sure to call out areas that could be improved with questions like, “Why did you choose to call this method?” or “Are there any other ways that can be done?”

**Teach the Teacher**

Teaching is sometimes the best way to learn. Have the student teach you a concept that they learned the prior week. This will be great reinforcement and will help the student discover gaps in her learning, without you haveing to directly call them out. 

**Pairing**

Pair programming is a great way to help a student tackle a problem, and gives them incredible insight to a method that many programmers use every day. Tools like madeye.io and nitrous.io are great for this, but feel free to use your favorite (as long as a student can use it for free)!

**Socratic Method**

The Socratic Method is a combination of all of the strategies above. The official definition is, “A pedagogical technique in which a teacher does not give information directly but instead asks a series of questions, with the result that the student comes either to the desired knowledge by answering the questions or to a deeper awareness of the limits of knowledge.” 

In plain English, this means that whenever possible, you should try to avoid directly answering students’ questions and instead asking the student smaller questions that help guide him or her to the right answer. For example, if a Python student were to ask:

“Why doesn’t this code work?: `print ‘yes’ + 3`”

The non-Socratic response would be, “Because you can’t concatenate strings and integers.” While that answer is true, it doesn’t help the student understand why you can’t add the two. 

The Socratic response would be, “Well, what are you trying to do? Ok, what do we know about data types? How can we check what data types we’re dealing with? Is there a way for us to turn these into the same data type? Now what happens?”

As you can see, this response is not as quick as a simple answer, but the methodology is incredibly important. Simply supplying the student with an answer encourages them to fix their code and move on. Asking “scaffolding questions,’ on the other hand, encourages them to think more deeply about the concepts involved and the desired output. One of the greatest skills a mentor can teach their student is how to think about problems and phrase their questions. Stack Overflow, Google, and language documentation contain a wealth of knowledge, but it is only accessible to those who know how to find it. 

##Chapter 4
####How to be a Badass Mentor

As a mentor, you are the reason students sign up to work with Thinkful. Now that you know some teaching strategies to use during your sessions, let’s look at some general pro tips to help you, and your student, get the most out of every moment you spend together. 

**Skip the small talk**

Just do it. It’s awkward, wastes time, and doesn’t accomplish much. Instead, develop a relationship by sharing knowledge and expressing sincere interest in your student and her goals. 

**Follow the 2/3rds rule**

About 2/3rds or 66.667% of the session should consist of the *student* speaking. This keeps the student engaged, and gives you the opportunity to show that you care about her unique learning style. This foundation of care is essential to building the rapport necessary for true learning. To keep meaningful conversation going, have core questions and clarifying questions prepared. You can find a list of awesome clarifying questions in Chapter 6.

**Be a Coach, Not a Cheerleader**

Our students are not learning to program just for the hell of it -- they’re learning because it will enable a dream. They want to work for themselves and have more time to travel, work at an interesting startup with an ambitious mission, or simply make more money. Whatever the dream is, you want to know it. Use your Jedi questioning skills to draw this information out, then use it to help frame your questions and keep the student on a successful track. 


**Set Ambitious and Achievable Goals**

No matter how motivated students are, what courses they take, or how much they pay, students will not be able to achieve their goals unless they create the conditions for rigorous learning. Don’t be afraid to be honost with your student about the time commitment she will have to make to succeed in her course. 


**Routine and Procedure are Your Best Friends**

Set routines and procedures from Day 1.

It would be GREAT if we had all the time in the world to create mind-blowingly fun mentor session plans for each of our students. The reality is that most of us have little to no time to prepare for each session. Instead, we rely on our accumulated experience to get us through.

Routine remedies this! By having an established procedure for running the mentor session, your student engages with a high quality session every single time without you thinking too much about it. Review our suggested weekly routine for you and students [HERE] and make sure to firmly set these routine into motion from the first session.

**Indirect Praise**

Less effective mentors sometime believe that excessive, direct praise like, “Wow, you did an amazing job!” or, “You are so good at this!” will increase student outcomes. In fact, the opposite is true.

These types of value judgements transform a coaching session into a time of evaluation and over time students become insensitive to the praise. Instead, provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the student's sufficient tackling of the problem. The student will deduce the praise themselves! Save direct positive feedback for those really, really special times.

**Indirect Negative Feedback**

Avoid ever explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keep working backward until they are able to self-correct.

**Awesome Analogies**

Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and fields, the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it!

**Speaking of Fun…**
The best way to be certain your student is enjoying the sessions is to make sure you are! Have fun with your student - we don’t want Thinkful to feel like a ‘job’ for you or your students. Bring in real world example, discuss hypothetical situations, make jokes about Flash - learning to code can be extremely challenging, and the goal is for students to look forward to meeting each week with a friend who wants them to love coding as much as they do.

####Mentor FAQ’s

Below, find some of the most common questions we get from mentors. Don’t see your question here? Email us or find us on Slack! We promise to get back to you ASAP

**My student wants to skip this week's session.**

Before anything else, use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors becomes more essential for students. You can ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared or lure them by sharing information that requires no preparation (like introducing developer tools). Do whatever you can to make that meeting happen. When you do have the meeting, simply follow your routine.

More broadly, begin to engrain in your student that your fundamental goal is to help them get out of tough situations. Don’t let them run away from hard parts of the curriculum — the benefits of learning to program are totally worth it. If they claim that the issue is external and that they are too busy, remind them of your belief in them. This may be the time to break the rules and provide strong, DIRECT feedback.



**My student didn't do any work this week. At all.**

Use scaffolding and the Socratic Method to work with student on their current spot in the course. There will be times where you may have to teach a concept explicitly. When in doubt, you can always share your screen and simply start coding yourself, introducing concepts and asking scaffolding questions as your student watches on. 

**My student is continually missing sessions.**

If students repeatedly refuse to meet let us know as soon as possible. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better support them and help them remember their commitment and goals. 

**What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?**

Hmmm. It depends. From our experience, the course material is foundational for building more advanced skills. The concepts that students often want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content if they wish to excel. 
Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it.
If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong grasp of the concept to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.

####Useful Resources for Mentors

Below, find some tools our mentors already use and love. Please feel free to explore these resources and use those you find helpful. Don’t see your favorite tool? Tell us about it by emailing zac@thinkful.com


(Emily - a lot of these look great! I wonder if we want to make an Index or Reference List at the end which includes some of the tools below?)

Thinkful Mentor Pro Tips! Share yours here today!
Can't live without madeye.io
Good question... haven't had enough sessions consistently with students to have any tips, but I appreciate seeing them come through on the Slack mentor room.
Joking! Making things fun!
Spend the necessary time listening. Your student dissevers an individual response ... don't just hear a tag and go off replaying a recording from you mind.
Use iiNet rather than Optus for your ISP when you do video calls. Optus just isn't stable enough for reliable chats. Okay, that's not exactly a tip that'll help anyone outside of Australia, and most people don't have a lot of ways to choose at short notice, but in case there's someone else in the position of having exactly those two connections... the tip is there. :)

Get to know Alice in Wonderland - the book, and the girl. Get to know her as a dear friend. Not so much a mentoring tip as a programming tip, but a better programmer will generally be a better mentor.

This is a really nice code-sharing app I found http://www.codeshare.io/ the best part is it shares the caret position, which is great for pointing out bits of code.

Python's REPL is very useful, I've had good success instructing students using it, they seem to like the immediate feedback it gives (JavaScript, and Ruby have REPls too).
Suggest students send through questions before the session, so that you can prepare any materials to make the most out of the session.
Do the assignments that the students have to do. This gives you a first hand experience to relate to the student with.
most of the tricks i learn are from other mentors, I just try to understand the students and make it as fun as possible
Ensuring to update the student diary right after or during the sessions.
* Prepare review questions and work with those on the student, they help the student self identify their learning gaps
* Be Humble
* Try to be accommodating if required to reschedule
I try to make my students feel as though I am on their team, working together to find the solution in the code.
Take note of the student's emotional state, and general mood. If they are totally frustrated they may need some help seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. You may need to take a more active role in getting them unstuck, just enough for them to get them back on track, but then reinforce how they can use the tools available to them to get help for the next issue. (G+, SO, documentation, etc)


The more your pair with your student, the more they will get out of it, especially if you do it on their machine, so they can continue to examine the code after your session.


They learn a lot from seeing how you deal with not knowing something. If they only see you in a state of "totally knowing everything", they get discouraged because they aren't there yet. If they see you encounter a challenge, break it down, test/experiment, and try new things, that gives them hope, and insight into how they can face the unknown, and tackle it.
Followup emails with content from session. This should already be done though.
- Keep a repository of examples
- Ask students what's their interest in this training.
- Find out how deep they want to get.
- Add additional material that might be applied to their jobs.
- Session invites, I send them out 24 hours prior to the session. I have found that if I send them out any earlier than that, students tend to forget.
- Prior to a session, I like to start a quick note pad and make note of last weeks goal, any projects they submitted during the week and feedback, and anything else that I need to go over with them
- Take notes during the session.
- If you don't know the answer, be honest with the student and use it as an example of how you'll never know everything and we're always learning. If I don't know the answer to something, as soon as my last session is over I start researching and provide an answer/explanation in my follow up email
- After every session, follow up with the student about what you talked about, expand on any concepts that you couldn't quite cover, and go over goals for the next session.
- Tough love, students are paying a good amount of money and it's our job to make sure that they dont' have to shell out more because they fell behind. Make sure you are clear with them that they are starting to fall behind and what they need to do to get back on track. Your students want to make you happy.
- 3 to 4 days after your session with the student, send them a little check up. Ask them how they are doing with their goal, something like: "Hey, just checking in. How are you making out with Unit 1, Lesson 2, Assignments 3 and 4?". This hopefully will start a little dialog about where they are in their studies. And hopefully prevent the common "Oh my god, my sessions tomorrow, I need to do my work today!" the day before the session.
Understand the technical knowledge (and limits) of the student and don't try to impress or overwhelm them. If they are having problems with a concept or project, scale it back and work together on smaller pieces of the concept then show how the sum is greater than the parts. Incremental accomplishment is just as successful as building a huge application at this level of learning.

Encourage them to use all the Thinkful resources, not just wait until they have the scheduled meeting with you - email, office hours, the community, other mentors, etc.
Sharing the student's screen (the full screen) and showing the student how Xcode and Interface Builder works seems to be very necessary and helpful for students. Also... everyone has a different skill set and background so I don't set expectations equally for all students. Students should be encouraged to start with simple apps, and they should be congratulated for their hard work and accomplishments. It's impractical to think that all students will have a "press-release-ready" app by the end of the course. For many students, the end of this course is only the beginning of their journey as an iOS developer.
Humour makes for an interesting session and a lifetime friendship with students. Me and the students always laugh, fun is part of the job :)
Being careful of who is "driving" is something ive been more conscious of recently. If I'm reviewing a student's code they wrote during the week, I usually pull it up on my screen. Otherwise if going over a concept I like to have them drive and me advise.
Always get feedback 50% - 60% through the week including topics the student wants to talk about for the next session.

Make the most of your first session with the student by way of introductions, discuss motivations and help them set realistic expectations. Start to build your mentor student relationship in this first session. Walk through the the tools and get a feel for their ability.

Try and give feedback 24 - 48 hours after receiving it. Don't overpromise on this as we are all very busy!

Lead & challenge the student. Don't just answer their questions.

Always bring web development back to the real world. Give them examples/advice within the context of team based development as this is mostly the context we find ourselves in.

Always give answers/guidance within the context of good architectural principles. eg. code should always be simple and maintainable

Put together a collection of metaphors that work for you in explaining foreign concepts such as: The DOM, event handling, selectors, jQuery, code structure, scope, variables, functions, http, AJAX

Be friendly - I saw advice saying treat your student as a co-worker. I would say treat them more like a junior intern. Lots of friendly help and advice leading them to greater and better things.

Make sure they know who they are building software for - their users and not themselves.

Make sure they understand their ultimate goal - to make happy and productive users (or sad and unproductive users I guess!!!) happier and more productive.

Keep an eye on the time. 30 minutes is not long. But stick to the time as we are accountable to the student to keep to this time limit and not give them the expectation that it can be dragged out.

Get the student to walk through the code to find out their level of understanding on a particular project.

Keep things project based. It is more fun, more relevant and keeps people from getting bored and learning nothing much. You will hit 'real world' development issues this way.

Email the student after the meeting as soon as possible (I must admit I am not very good at this!). It keeps them focussed.
Let the student lead, but have a backup plan in case they're not super engaged. Pair programming on their current project is usually pretty effective.
Be a friend, be ready to admit when you don't know, and be ready to figure out the stuff that you yourself are shaky on.
If a student has particular questions about understanding a certain concept it really helps to enforce your explanation with additional resources that will allow the student to read in their own time. I often go away after a session and supply links to reading material explaining items a student had questions to, that ensures the student grasps the concept and they are reassured that what they are reading is advisable and best practice.
Record yourself mentoring and watch it back. It's generally shocking, but you learn a lot about what you do well and badly.

Don't worry if you have a bad session - it happens. But after any bad session try to think about why it went badly, and what could have been done to change it.

Try to have fun in the sessions. Chances are if you are enjoying it your student is too.
Always try to guide your student to the best of your ability and make it clear how long you can engage with them, some students might need like 24 hours monitoring.
Always follow up after a session to recap what was done, what needs to be done for the next session. If you went over any processes, steps, or concepts, explain them again in the e-mail so the students can review them and reference them on their own.
Listen to what your student has to say and understand why they are saying it.
Screen sharing is essential.



maintain a personal knowledge base of past experiences and how I should have better handled the situation. notes on what i should be bringing up with students when covering certain topic areas
I've found that pair programming is an extremely effective learning tool and it works well during mentoring sessions. I've used TDD while pairing with all of my students when they get to the unit testing sections and they've all picked up testing (and TDD) very quickly.
Don't teach! Encourage students to learn!

Understanding a student's question and needs is more important than knowing a good answer.

Never do the work for them and if you do, make them tell you everything about it!

Don't be scared to challenge the students or take them on a new journey if it's something they're asking for!
* Showing students how to work through a problem that you don't understand is extremely helpful. It's one thing to immediately spit out an answer, but it's a different matter when they see the mentor themselves not know an answer to a question or problem and work through it.

* Patience, patience, patience. We as teachers / mentors have the "curse of knowledge". It's easy to forget what it's like not to know something. Constantly trying to find new ways to explain things is an excellent exercise that solidifies our own knowledge as well as builds an arsenal of ways to teach different students the same subject. I'm not trying to imply that mentors get irritated or impatient when explaining stuff to their students, but more to just reiterate the fact that when you're just starting out, it helps to go over things multiple times in different ways.

* Talking about a concept is good, but writing the code in front of the student is ALWAYS better. Definitely explain things every step of the way. If you can't explain every line of code you're writing, why are you writing it? Finally, the "a-ha" moment always occurs when you run the code in front of the student as well -- especially if you discover a bug and work through it with them.

* Be harsh on yourself when it comes to requirements of knowledge. What I mean by this: As programmers we often will use pieces of code / technology that we don't completely understand because it gets the job done. This is fine when you don't have to teach someone, but when it comes to mentoring students, it's really important to be able to explain things. There's nothing worse than hearing "I don't really know what that does, but just leave it in there anyway". You're just creating more gaps in knowledge and the students will often get disheartened that way.

* Have students walk through every line of code at times, it's a good exercise both for you and them. Basically, do live code reviews.

* In the FEWD course it's focused more on code than design. That's fine, but sometimes students will code something up that is technically sound but just doesn't look as nice aesthetically as some other stuff they've seen out there (or even in other student projects). This can be discouraging in its own right. Helping them improve their design by giving tips, feedback, etc, can make their projects look more beautiful. When they start to create more aesthetically pleasing stuff, they get way more excited about working on and learning new things. Beauty is motivational.
Often as a mentor I find myself giving my students advice on being a freelancer, selling yourself, and really awesome SEO and online marketing blogs and websites to follow. I think it's equally as important to know how to market yourself as it is to be competent as a programmer.
Keep learning through doing. Sometimes I find I'm working on a particular problem in my own projects and it appears in some form for the student, so I can address the problem through my growing base of experience.
Give your students your valuable experience tips. I have so many students thank me for telling them things they would normally need years to learn on their own.
take notes, ask about the mood, try to understand the student´s motivations, focus on the student more than the curriculum.
This book is amazing for anyone involved in teaching or studying:

Make it Stick: The Science of Successful Learning
Peter C. Brown, et al
Belknap Press, 2014
Take 5 minutes before the session and look back at what you and the student discussed last week and during the week. Then take 5 minutes after to fill out the session logs at the mentor panel and make notes for yourself for next week.
I'm constantly learning things outside of my own area of expertise so it's easier to put myself in my students shoes. I never try to come off as an expert but more like a slightly more knowledgable colleague. The key for me is to hold back as much as necessary to not intimidate them.

I take a lot of notes during sessions and review them before meeting with a student. I make sure to review any big concepts that we discussed in previous sessions to make sure it wasn't forgotten and try to tie it into what the student is working on now.

I let my students know that if they hit a wall to not hesitate to email me questions, but I don't email them right back. I usually wait at least a few hours or sometimes even till the next day. I find that by writing out the problem in an email they start to think about what they're trying to do more concretely. 9 times out of 10 I get another email the next day saying never mind and that they figured it out themselves.

I want my students to be able to discover as much as they can on their own. It feels more like a victory to them and keeps their enthusiasm up. Also, it's much harder to forget something they came to on their own vs something someone told them in an email.



the css "outline" property for all elements, like "* { outline: solid 1px red}" it's a great way to demonstrate the layout of boxes. 


CUT

Here are a some things you may find yourself telling students:

* You (the student) need to honestly invest enough time. 12 hours a week is our minimum. If you can’t invest 12 hours each week, you may find yourself unsatisfied with your progress.
* Block time off in your calendar immediately. Shift things around, speak to family and friends and set the expectation with them that you are going to be committed to learning this for the next 3 months.
* Find a consistent learning environment that works for you. It may be a coffee shop or the kitchen table. Have it be consistent and free of inhibiting distractions.
* See if a friend is willing to learn with you. Having an accountability partner will greatly enhance the chances of you learning this stuff. We offer an incentive for this as well.
* Attend Office Hours. In supplement to your mentor session, you can connect with mentors during the additional 12 open office hours offered each week. You can always head to Slack and use !officehours to find out when the next session will be hosted. 
* Speaking of Slack, you should engage in that community. Getting quick feedback on projects is critical, and knowing that others are in your same boat is both helpful and fun. Read through and critique other students’ code. Understanding a codebase someone else wrote is a valuable skill.
* As you work throughout the week, keep track of questions or difficult sections. We will use these notes to get the most out of every mentor session.
