##Chapter 1
####Welcome to Thinkful!
We are laser-focused on student success. Other companies focus on producing content; we’re fans of them, and even use their content, but we’re in a different business. We don’t want to produce learning materials, we want to produce *learning*. We’re not satisfied with people buying our courses; we expect to provide the optimal conditions for them to actually learn. At Thinkful, these conditions are based on three core pillars:


1. One-on-one mentorship

2. Active student community

3. Exceptional course content


To keep our students engaged and excited to learn, our courses are project-driven. Lessons begin with projects that guide this learning. A project-driven structure allows students to learn from real-world experiences, draw connections to those experiences, and internalize new ideas. No boring lectures. No endless chunks of text. As a mentor, you are an essential ingredient for the success of both your students and our mission, and we couldn’t be happier to have you on the team. Welcome to Thinkful!



##Chapter 2
####Mentorship Behind the Scenes

Here is a brief overview of the tools you will be using as a Thinkful Mentor

+*Gmail* | You have been setup with an @thinkful.com email address. Please use this address to communicate with your students and Thinkful HQ - feel free to forward messages to your regular email if you’d like!

+*Slack* | Slack is our community portal for both mentors and students. We have two different “teams” on slack - one for students, and another for mentors/staff (thinkful-students.slack.com vs. thinkful.slack.com). You can think of these as the student lounge and the faculty lounge. As a mentor, you’ll have access to both. Feel free to use this tool as much or as little as you would like, and keep in mind that it’s a great place to meet other mentors and ask questions about the mentoring process. It’s also a great place to promote your side projects and meet awesome developers from all over the world!

+*Mentor Panel* (thinkful.com/patel/mentor_panel) | This is your home page at Thinkful. From your mentor panel, you can:
+Set and update your availability (keep an eye on the time zone!)
+Adjust the number of students you would like to mentor
+Find all of your students, their courses, and your meeting times/days
+Record all of your session notes
+It is extremely important that you record session notes after every session. These notes help us keep track of student progress and make sure students’ needs are being met. If a student doesn’t show up for a session, be sure to log “Session did not occur” in your notes for the week. 

+*Video Chat* (Google Hangouts, TokBox, Skype, or your prefered tool) | You will be meeting with your student each week at the same time using your favorite video chat tool. Please make sure both you and your student test this tool before your first session - there’s nothing more frustrating than excitement devolving into frustration when it takes forever to connect due to technical reasons. Be sure to *over* communicate to your students when and how you will be meeting, and be sure to show up at least 5 minutes before your session. 

When you are first matched with a student, you will receive an email from our student support team introducing you to your mentee. It’s a great practice to write the student directly to both introduce yourself and set the tone for your sessions. Be brief, be funny, be awesome. Ask your student if they have any questions before your first session, and let them know you’re excited to be working with them!



##Chapter 3
####Your First Mentor Session

**Before Your First Session**
Prior to meeting with a student for the first time, please take a few steps to ensure you’re ready to be the best mentor they could have hoped for. These steps include:

+An email sent before the session that introduces you, a bit of your work, and asks the student if they have any questions ahead of your initial meeting

+Checking to make sure your video chat platform is working. Be sure to check both the camera and the microphone!

+Familiarizing yourself with the curriculum 

+As a mentor, we don’t expect you to read every word of every course you’re mentoring. However, it is important to take a look at the concepts and goals introduced at each step during the course. Please take some time to understand what’s being asked of your students so you can be in the best position to anticipate their questions or pain points. 

+Preparing clarifying questions 

+Whether or not the student has specific questions for you, you should have a list of questions prepared for your student. These questions should be comprehension checks for material covered in the first several lessons of the course. 

+Getting online at least 5 minutes before your session. 

**During Your First Session**

Skip the small talk! You’ve already introduced yourself via email, and getting right down to business will be less awkward and demonstrate to your student how much you care about her coding journey. 

The first session is a great time to learn a bit more about your student - what are her past experiences and future goals? Every student comes to Thinkful with some goal in mind, and you want to know what it is! Spend a few minutes getting to know what programming experience your student has (if any!) and how Thinkful will help them reach their next goal. 

Once you have learned about your student’s goals, it’s time to get right to it! Begin discussing the course material with the student, and start to gauge how enthusiastic they are about learning these new skills. Be sure to let your student do most of the talking - remember, this isn’t a *lecture*. Ask questions about concepts your student has covered and listen for comprehension. We will discuss specific tips and tricks for hosting a kickass session in the next chapter. 

Be sure to close your session by reminding your student how much you look forward to working with them for the next three months, and letting them know the best way to get in touch with you if they have questions before you meet again. Finally, set a specific goal for your student to achieve by your next meeting - every session should end with setting this goal, and all future sessions should begin by reviewing the previous week’s goal. 

**After The Session**

Be sure to visit the Mentor Panel and fill out your session notes for the meeting! This should only take 2-3 minutes, but is an essential way for you, and for us, to keep track of your student’s progress. Remember, students will never have access to these notes, so feel free to be be honest about their level of engagement and their progress. 

Two to three days after your session, it’s a great habit to send your student a short email reminding them what you covered in your last meeting and what they are working on for the next week. It’s a helpful reminder to them of what they should be doing, and more importantly, that you care about their progress. 

Congrats! You’ve now made it through your first mentor session and are well on your way to becoming a Thinkful Ninja (Thinja?). Remember, you can always reach out to the Thinkful HQ mentor team if you have any questions or issues.

##Chapter 4
#### The Socratic Method and XXX Other Coaching Strategies

Every student has a different learning style, and no two sessions will be exactly the same. Sometimes, your student will come prepared with a list of questions and difficult concepts. Othertimes, they will simply show up and expect you to drive the session. By familiarizing yourself with the strategies below and using the right ones at the right times, you will ensure that every minute spent with your student is helping them with their work. 

**Teach a Man to Fish**

Many cultures have a saying along the lines of, “If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day. If you teach a man to fish, he will eat for life.” This concept is a perfect analogy for mentorship. If you simply answer every question a student poses, they will never learn how to find answers on their own. Instead, help them learn how to use Google, Stack Overflow, documentation, and other resources to get their questions answered when you’re not around. 

**Scaffolding Questions**

There are different levels of questions. Lower level questions are easier and have clear, right or wrong answers (e.g. “When do we use the <head> tag?”). Higher level questions are harder and involve application of a variety of concepts within a real world setting (e.g. “What’s the best way to display our menu bar?”). The “Scaffolding Questions” technique uses low level questions to build up to higher level questions. Many mentors fall into the trap of either a) preserving student self esteem by dumbing down questions and never challenging students adequately, or b) asking higher level questions too early in a session and leaving students confused. By asking questions that start simple and become more complex, you will help your student develop critical thinking skills and learn how to work through tough problems on their own. 

**Code Tour**

Many students can make something that works without understanding *why* it works. Asking them to “walkthrough” the code, explaining what each line does, allows them to recognize the “why” behind each action. Be sure to call out areas that could be improved with questions like, “Why did you choose to call this method?” or “Are there any other ways that can be done?”

**Teach the Teacher**

Teaching is sometimes the best way to learn. Have the student teach you a concept that they learned the prior week. This will be great reinforcement and will help the student discover gaps in her learning, without you having to directly call them out. 

**Pairing**

Pair programming is a great way to help a student tackle a problem, and gives them incredible insight to a method that many programmers use every day. Tools like madeye.io and nitrous.io are great for this, but feel free to use your favorite (as long as a student can use it for free)!

**Socratic Method**

The Socratic Method is a combination of all of the strategies above. The official definition is, “A pedagogical technique in which a teacher does not give information directly but instead asks a series of questions, with the result that the student comes either to the desired knowledge by answering the questions or to a deeper awareness of the limits of knowledge.” 

In plain English, this means that whenever possible, you should try to avoid directly answering students’ questions and instead ask the student smaller questions that help guide him or her to the right answer. For example, if a Python student were to ask:

“Why doesn’t this code work?: `print ‘yes’ + 3`”

The non-Socratic response would be, “Because you can’t concatenate strings and integers.” While that answer is true, it doesn’t help the student understand why you can’t add the two. 

The Socratic response would be, “Well, what are you trying to do? Ok, what do we know about data types? How can we check what data types we’re dealing with? Is there a way for us to turn these into the same data type? Now what happens?”

As you can see, this response is not as quick as the simple answer, but the methodology is incredibly important. Simply supplying the student with an answer encourages her to fix their code and move on. Asking “scaffolding questions,’ on the other hand, encourages them to think more deeply about the concepts involved and the desired output, and taking this Socratic approach will help develop your student’s critical thinking skills. 

##Chapter 5
####How to Be a Badass Mentor

As a mentor, you are the reason students sign up to work with Thinkful. Now that you know some teaching strategies to use during your sessions, let’s look at some general pro tips to help you, and your student, get the most out of every moment you spend together. 

**Routine and Procedure are Your Best Friends**

Set routines and procedures from Day 1.

It would be GREAT if we had all the time in the world to create mind-blowingly fun mentor session plans for each of our students. The reality is that most of us have little to no time to prepare for each session. Instead, we rely on our accumulated experience to get us through.

Routine remedies this! By having an established procedure for running the mentor session, your student engages with a high quality session every single time without you thinking too much about it. Make sure to firmly set these routine into motion from the first session.

**Skip the Small Talk**

Just do it. It’s awkward, wastes time, and doesn’t accomplish much. Instead, develop a relationship by sharing knowledge and expressing sincere interest in your student and her goals. 

**Follow the 2/3rds Rule**

About 2/3rds or 66.667% of the session should consist of the *student* speaking. This keeps the student engaged, and gives you the opportunity to show that you care about her unique learning style. This foundation of care is essential to building the rapport necessary for true learning. To keep meaningful conversation going, have core concepts and clarifying questions prepared.

**Be a Coach, Not a Cheerleader**

Our students are not learning to program just for the hell of it -- they’re learning because it will enable a dream. They want to work for themselves and have more time to travel, work at an interesting startup with an ambitious mission, or simply make more money. Whatever the dream is, you want to know it. Use your Jedi questioning skills to draw this information out, then use it to help frame your questions and keep the student on a successful track. 

**Set Ambitious and Achievable Goals**

No matter how motivated students are, what courses they take, or how much they pay, students will not be able to achieve their goals unless they create the conditions for rigorous learning. Don’t be afraid to be honest with your student about the time commitment she will have to make to succeed in her course. 

**Indirect Praise**

Less effective mentors sometime believe that excessive, direct praise like, “Wow, you did an amazing job!” or, “You are so good at this!” will increase student outcomes. In fact, the opposite is true.

These types of value judgements transform a coaching session into a time of evaluation and over time students become insensitive to the praise. Instead, provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the student's sufficient tackling of the problem. The student will deduce the praise themselves! Save direct positive feedback for those really, really special times.

**Indirect Negative Feedback**

Avoid ever explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keep working backward until they are able to self-correct.

**Awesome Analogies**

Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and fields, the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it!

**Speaking of Fun…**

The best way to be certain your student is enjoying the sessions is to make sure you are! Have fun with your student - we don’t want Thinkful to feel like a ‘job’ for you or your students. Bring in real world example, discuss hypothetical situations, make jokes about Flash - learning to code can be extremely challenging, and the goal is for students to look forward to meeting each week with a friend who wants them to love coding as much as they do.

####Mentor FAQ’s

Below, find some of the most common questions we get from mentors. Don’t see your question here? Email us or find us on Slack! We promise to get back to you ASAP.

**My student wants to skip this week's session.**

Before anything else, use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors becomes more essential for students. You can ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared or lure them by sharing information that requires no preparation (like introducing developer tools). Do whatever you can to make that meeting happen. When you do have the meeting, simply follow your routine.

More broadly, begin to engrain in your student that your fundamental goal is to help them get out of tough situations. Don’t let them run away from hard parts of the curriculum — the benefits of learning to program are totally worth it. If they claim that the issue is external and that they are too busy, remind them of your belief in them. This may be the time to break the rules and provide strong, DIRECT feedback.

**I won’t be able to attend this week’s session**

We understand that life happens (even to the best of us!), and there may be sessions you are simply unable to attend due to health, family, travel, or other reasons. When this happens, you are welcome to connect with your student and try to reschedule for another time *that week*. If you expect to be absent for more than a week, or cannot reschedule with your student, please contact support@thinkful.com for help. 

**My student didn't do any work this week. At all.**

Use scaffolding and the Socratic Method to work with the student on their current spot in the course. There will be times where you may have to teach a concept explicitly. When in doubt, you can always share your screen and simply start coding yourself, introducing concepts and asking scaffolding questions as your student watches on. 

**My student is continually missing sessions.**

If students repeatedly refuse to meet let us know as soon as possible. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better support them and help them remember their commitment and goals. 

**What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?**

Hmmm. It depends. From our experience, the course material is foundational for building more advanced skills. The concepts that students often want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content if they wish to excel. 
Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it.
If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong grasp of the concept to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.

##Conclusion
####Go Forth and Think

That’s all folks! Once again, welcome to the team. We’re glad to have you, and hope you get as much out of mentorship as possible. Remember to always record session notes right after meeting with a student, and know that those of us in the office are always happy to hear from you with questions large or small. We encourage you to log into Slack and introduce yourself to the other mentors, and look forward to getting you your first students soon.

I try to make my students feel as though I am on their team, working together to find the solution in the code.


Do the assignments that the students have to do. This gives you a first hand experience to relate to the student with.


Always bring web development back to the real world. Give them examples/advice within the context of team based development as this is mostly the context we find ourselves in.

Always give answers/guidance within the context of good architectural principles. eg. code should always be simple and maintainable

They learn a lot from seeing how you deal with not knowing something. If they only see you in a state of "totally knowing everything", they get discouraged because they aren't there yet. If they see you encounter a challenge, break it down, test/experiment, and try new things, that gives them hope, and insight into how they can face the unknown, and tackle it.


- Keep a repository of examples and put together a collection of metaphors that work for you in explaining foreign concepts such as: The DOM, event handling, selectors, jQuery, code structure, scope, variables, functions, http, AJAX)

- Add additional material that might be applied to their jobs.
- Session invites, I send them out 24 hours prior to the session. I have found that if I send them out any earlier than that, students tend to forget.


- Tough love, students are paying a good amount of money and it's our job to make sure that they dont' have to shell out more because they fell behind. Make sure you are clear with them that they are starting to fall behind and what they need to do to get back on track. Your students want to make you happy.


* Showing students how to work through a problem that you don't understand is extremely helpful. It's one thing to immediately spit out an answer, but it's a different matter when they see the mentor themselves not know an answer to a question or problem and work through it.
* Patience, patience, patience. We as teachers / mentors have the "curse of knowledge". It's easy to forget what it's like not to know something. Constantly trying to find new ways to explain things is an excellent exercise that solidifies our own knowledge as well as builds an arsenal of ways to teach different students the same subject.















Record yourself mentoring and watch it back. It's generally shocking, but you learn a lot about what you do well and badly.

Don't worry if you have a bad session - it happens. But after any bad session try to think about why it went badly, and what could have been done to change it.


















Often as a mentor I find myself giving my students advice on being a freelancer, selling yourself, and really awesome SEO and online marketing blogs and websites to follow. I think it's equally as important to know how to market yourself as it is to be competent as a programmer.
