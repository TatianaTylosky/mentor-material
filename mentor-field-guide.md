##Chapter 1:
**Our Learning Philosophy Here at Thinkful**: We are laser-focused on student success. Other companies focus on producing content; we’re fans of them, and even use their content, but we’re in a different business. We don’t want to produce learning materials, we want to produce *learning*. We’re not satisfied with people buying our courses; we expect to provide the optimal conditions for them to actually learn. Below is our official Learning Philosophy - the guiding principles that drive all of our educational decisions.

1. Real learning is fundamentally human.

2. Real learning happens when education is relevant to students’ interests and project-based.

3. Real learning is self-initiated but community supported.

	It would be nice to add a quick line or two about how these goals and our model our founded on strong mentorship. This is the first "official" looking text (not from an email) we send to mentors and possible a good place to underscore just how important they are to what we do.

You’ll lean more psychologist than educator for this first session. Ask your student about her backstory, motivations, and dreams. (<20 minutes)

**Goal Breakdown**

Paint a vivid picture of the path your student must take to get from where she is now to where she wants to be -- emphasizing where Thinkful fits within that journey.

**Set High Expectations and Routines**

This is your pep talk. Firmly express what your student needs to do -- how much they have to commit -- to ultimately reach their goal.

##Chapter 3:
**8 Tips on how to have a badass first mentor session.**
Below are 8 tips on how to do build an incredible first impression and will inspire students.

1. Skip the small talk.
Just do it. It’s awkward, wastes time, and doesn’t accomplish much.
2. Follow the 66.667% Rule.
About 2/3rds, 20 minutes of the 30 minute session, or 66.667% of the session should consist of the student speaking. This keeps the students engaged, and gives you the opportunity to show your care about her goals. This foundation of care is essential to build the rapport necessary for true learning. To keep meaningful conversation going, have core questions and clarifying questions prepared. You can find a list of awesome clarifying questions in Chapter 6.
3. Be a Mickey Goldmill.
Our students aren’t learning to program for the hell of it -- they’re learning because it enables a dream. They want to work for themselves and and have more time to travel, work at an interesting startup with an ambitious mission, or simply make more money. Whatever the dream is, you want to know it. Use your Jedi question-asking skills to draw this information out, and then validate their dream. Supporting your student will have a huge, positive impact on her learning if the student follows up with committed skill building.
4. Prepare clarifying questions.
For this first session, its critical to draw deep answers from students. Its
5.Work with students to break their “dream” down to measurable, specific “objectives”.
A huge dream like “finding a job at a startup” is not helpful. Before landing a job you need to demonstrate certain skills. Those skills are made up of sub-skills and objectives. Help your student create a clear, measurable, path to achieving her dream. In this phase, its essential that you share how their work with Thinkful fits within their journey to achieving her dream. More often than not, Thinkful is an early step towards building the foundational skills she needs to navigate the path on their own 5. Set high, but necessary expectations.
No matter how motivated she is, how much she pays, or what courses she’s signed up for, students will not be able to achieve their goals unless they create the conditions for rigorous learning.
Here are a few tips to emphasize:
5
￼• You (the student) need to honestly invest enough time. 12 hours a week is our minimum. If you can’t invest 12 hours each week, you may find yourself unsatisfied with your progress.
• Block time off in your calendar immediately. Shift things around, speak to family and friends and set the expectation with them that you are going to be committed to learning this for the next 3 months.
• Find a consistent learning environment that works for you. It may be a coffee shop or the kitchen table. Have it be consistent and free of inhibiting distractions.
• See if a friend is willing to learn with you. Having an accountability partner will greatly enhance the chances of you learning this stuff. We offer an incentive for this as well.
• Attend Office Hours. In supplement to your mentor session, you can connect with mentors during the additional 12 open office hours offered each week.
• Engage your Google+ community. Getting quick feedback on projects is critical. Read through and critique other students’ code. Understanding a codebase someone else wrote is a valuable skill.
• Each week, no matter what, fill out your RECAP form.
7. Routine and Procedure are your best friends.
Set routines and procedures from day 1.
It would be GREAT if we had all the time in the world to create mind-blowingly fun mentor session plans for each of our students. The reality is that most of us have little to no time to
6
￼prepare for each session. Instead, we rely on our accumulated experience to get us through.
Routine remedies this! By having an established procedure for running the mentor session, your student engages with a high quality session every single time without you thinking much about it. Review our suggested weekly routine for you and students [HERE] and make sure to firmly set these routine into motion from the first session.
8. Be short and sweet when talking about yourself. If possible, show, don’t tell.
You only need to two sentences to introduce your background. You’d be surprised how quickly students will pick it up from there with questions.

￼1. Mentor Session: Set Sprint Goal
Mentor sessions are 30 minutes, once a week per student. At the end of each session its important that you set a Weekly Sprint Goal -- a short term goal that the student is expected to accomplish in the upcoming week.
2. CRM
Immediately after each session, fill out your students’ CRM. This allows you to keep record on your students’ progress and allows us to keep track of everyone’s progress.
3. Send Follow Up E-mail
After each session, be sure to write a quick follow up e-mail summarizing what was covered in the session and clearly stating the Sprint Goal.
4. Engage in Google+ Community with other students
Sometime in the middle of the week, take time to explore our student Google+ communities and engage students with any questions they may have. Its also a great place to provide feedback on student projects.
5. Send Session & RECAP Form reminder
In GMAIL, automate an e-mail one day before each session requesting students to send in their e-mail and their

￼Chapter 7:
The Socratic method and 6 other awesome coaching strategies.
1. Indirect Praise.
Less effective mentors sometime believe that excessive direct praise like, “wow, you did an amazing job” or “you are so good at this” will increase student outcomes. The opposite is true.
These type of value judgements transform a coaching session into a time of evaluation and over time students become insensitive to the praise. Instead, provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the students sufficient tackling of the problem. The student will deduce the praise themselves! Save direct positive feedback for those really, really special times.
2. Indirect Negative Feedback.
Avoid ever explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keeping working backwards until they are able to self correct.
10
￼3. Scaffolding Questions
There are different levels of questions. Lower level questions are easier and have clear, right or wrong answers. Higher level questions are harder and involve application of a variety of concepts within a real world setting. “Scaffolding Questions” technique uses low level questions to build up to higher level questions. Many mentors fall into the trap of preserving student self esteem by dumbing down questions and never challenging students adequately or asking higher level questions to early in a session leaving students confused.
4. Code tour
Many students can make something that works without understandingwhyitworks.Askingthemto“walkthrough” the code, explaining what each line does, allows them to recognize the “why” behind each action.
5. Teach the teacher
Teaching is sometimes the best way to learn. Have the student teach you a concept that they learned the prior week. This will be great reinforcement and will uncover learning gaps.
6. Awesome Analogies
Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and
11
￼fields., the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it!
7. Socratic Method
The Socratic Method is a combination of all of the strategies above. The official definition is, “A pedagogical technique in which a teacher does not give information directly but instead asks a series of questions, with the result that the student comes either to the desired knowledge by answering the questions or to a deeper awareness of the limits of knowledge.” A teacher accomplishes this by integrating all of the techniques above to achieve a clear learning goal.

￼Chapter 8:
Emergency Mentor Moments -- what to do during extra tough mentor situations.
My student wants to skip this sessions.
Before anything else, use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors become more essential for students. You can ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared or lure them by sharing information that requires no preparation (like introducing developer tools). Whatever you do, make that meeting happen.
When you do have the meeting, simply follow your routine.
More broadly, begin to engrain in your student that your sole existence is to help them get out of tough situations. Don’t let them run away from hard parts of the curriculum — the benefits of learning to program is totally worth it. If they claim that the issue is external and that they are too busy, remind them of your belief in them. This may be the time to break the rules and provide strong, DIRECT feedback.
13
My student didn't do any work this week. At all.
Use scaffolding and the Socratic Method to work with student on their current spot in the course. There will be times where you may have to teach a concept explicitly.
My student is continually missing sessions.
If students refuse to meet, and this happens continually, let us know as soon as possible. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better offer support them and remind them of their commitment and goals.
What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?
Hmmm. It depends.
From our experience, the course material is foundational for building other skills off of. The concepts that students often want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content to excel at. Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it.
If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong grasp of the concept to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.
