##Chapter 1
####Welcome to Thinkful!

“If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day. If you teach a man to fish, he will eat for life.” This proverb is a great analogy for Thinkful’s mission!* 

Thinkful was founded by Dan Friedman and Darrell Silver in 2012 in New York City. On a mission to reinvent education, Thinkful teaches the workforce sustainable career skills. 

Help us advance careers by providing goal oriented one-on-one mentorship to Thinkful students. Our courses are project-driven and supported by a thriving student community. We believe relationships drive learning. As a mentor, the relationships you build are essential for the success of both your students and our mission. We couldn’t be happier to have you on the team. Welcome to Thinkful!

*Although we don’t currently cover fishing or phishing in any of our courses...

#### The Socratic Method and Other Coaching Strategies

A coach is someone who can give correction without causing resentment. - John Wooden

**Be a Coach**

Just like no two games are the same, no two sessions will be the same. Every student has a different learning style, it’s up to you to write their playbook. Hold you students accountable to themselves. Know their strengths and weaknesses. Plan drills and set training schedules. Use the strategies below to ensure every minute spent with your student is working toward achieving their goal. 

**Socratic Method**

Python student: “Why doesn’t this code work?: `print ‘yes’ + 3`”

Socratic Response: “What are you trying to do? What do we know about data types? How can we check what data types we’re dealing with? Is there a way for us to turn these into the same data type? Now what happens?”

Non-Socratic Response: “Because you can’t concatenate strings and integers.” While that answer is true, it doesn’t help the student understand why you can’t add the two. 

As you can see, the Socratic response is not as quick as the simple answer, but the methodology is incredibly important. Encourage students to problem solve by engaging in a discourse which builds upon their prior knowledge. 

*Now this is teaching someone how to fish...

**Teach the Teacher**

Teaching is a great way to learn. Have your students teach you concepts they learned the prior week. Articulating new concepts builds confidence, cements knowledge and will help the student discover gaps in her learning.

**Scaffolding**
 
You know how people say they “hit a wall” when learning something new? Scaffolding is building steps so anyone can safely climb over any wall of knowledge.
 
Some things Thinkful does to scaffold curriculum:
-Breaking courses into assignments (mini-lessons)
-Gradually increasing the complexity throughout the course (geared towards absolute beginners)
-Having students commit project intermittently so Mentors can view progress before students submit a completed project
-Describing objectives in the unit/lesson intros

A few things you can do to scaffold curriculum:
-Send students a list of terms to know before they start a lesson 
-Relate new lessons/assignments to skills/concepts learned previously
-Show students models or examples of what they will be building 
-Share follow-up readings or set an additional stretch goal with your students

**Code Review**

Many students can make something that works without understanding *why* it works. Asking them to review their code and explain what each line does, allows them to recognize the “why” behind each action. Be sure to call out areas that could be improved with questions like, “Why did you choose to call this method?” or “Are there any other ways that can be done?” In a code review, you can also suggest other implementation alternatives, challenging the student to weigh all options.

**Pair Programming**

Pair programming is a great way to teach students how to tackle problems, and gives them incredible insight to a method that many programmers use every day. Read up on Pair-Programming Styles. We recommend you be the navigator! Tools like madeye.io and nitrous.io are great for this, but feel free to suggest your favorite.

**Awesome Analogies**

Research proves that deep learning occurs when new knowledge is linked with prior knowledge. Analogies are a great way to do this. Use cars and their components to explain classes and fields, the animal kingdom to explain inheritance, shapes to explain polymorphism -- have fun with it!

**Indirect Praise and Feedback**

Direct praise like, “Wow, you did an amazing job!” or, “You are so good at this!” does not increase student outcomes.

Instead, it is more effective to provide indirect positive feedback by objectively stating how hard a problem was and acknowledge the student's problem solving approach or work ethic. The student will deduce the praise themselves! 

Similarly, avoid explicitly stating that your student has made a mistake. Let your students find their own errors. Provide hints by asking about specific lines of code and why they wrote it that way. Keep working backward until they are able to self-correct.

####Mentor FAQ’s

Below, find some of the most common questions we get from mentors. Don’t see your question here? Email us or find us on Slack! We will get back to you ASAP.

**The course uses one tool, I usually use another, is that ok?**

Yes. Part of being a mentor is sharing your best practices, workflows and tools with students. If want to introduce a tool you believe will serve your student’s long term goal, please share it with them, especially if it is a free resource. (And be patient helping them set it up.)

**My student wants to skip this week's session.**

Use all of your power to make the meeting happen. As the course work gets tougher, and life gets busier, engagement with mentors becomes more essential for students. Not having completed work or understanding everything are both used by students as reasons to skip mentor sessions. Ask them to commit to meeting for only 10 minutes even if they have no material prepared. Treat the time like a sprint meeting.

10 Minute Activities:
share a best practice
introduce developer tools
start the next project together
example
example
example (requires no preparation)

**My student didn't do any work this week. At all.**

See “My student wants to skip this week’s session.”

**My student is continually missing sessions.**

One common area of confusion is what to do when a student fails to attend sessions. (It happens, we all have students stand us up.) Here is what to do:

Log the missed session in your mentor panel (make a note if you know why)
Do your best to connect with the student and see if you two can reschedule within the week
If your student is radio-silent for a full week send another note, this time cc support@thinkful.com
Support will contact student (keeping you cc'd)
If support does not hear back within the week they will withdraw your student
One week later the system will remove this student from your list of active students making way for a new student eager to learn with you!

Our mighty support team is here for you and your students! Be sure to direct your students here if they need help with enrollment status, extensions, certificates, etc. We’ll follow up with them to see if there’s anything we can do to better support them meet their commitment and goals. 

**What should I do if a student wants to go way off the curriculum?**

Hmmm. It depends. From our experience, the course material is foundational for building more advanced skills. The concepts that students often want to cover outside of the curriculum usually require a strong grasp of curriculum content if they wish to excel. 
Students don’t want to replace curriculum content, they want to supplement it.
If students persist, assess where the students are at. If they have a strong grasp of the concept to engage the side project, feel free to do it. If they haven’t gained the necessary foundational skills to accomplish their project ideas — walk them through exactly why veering away from the curriculum is a bad idea.

**I won’t be able to attend this week’s session**

Life happens (even to the best of us!), and there may be sessions you are simply unable to attend. When this happens, please connect with your student and try to reschedule for another time *that same week*. If you expect to be absent for more than a week, or cannot reschedule with your student, please contact support@thinkful.com for help. 

If you are planning a vacation please let us know at least two weeks in advance so we can make plans too!

**What do I invoice you for exactly?**

We estimate about an hour/per week/per student, 45 mins in session + 15mins dedicated to completing session records and corresponding with students. That said, we are more interested in successful student outcomes than a few extra minutes on an invoice. As long as you feel like your student is respecting your time and any communication boundaries you've set with them, we are happy for you to work with them and bill us for the time.* Send invoices to invoices@thinkful.com.

*If this starts to look like a different product model where your student sees you as “on-call” or you’re providing multiple sessions per week, let us know. Remind your student to attend office hours and leverage the student community for support as well!

I try to make my students feel as though I am on their team, working together to find the solution in the code.

Do the assignments that the students have to do. This gives you a first hand experience to relate to the student with.
lways bring web development back to the real world. Give them examples/advice within the context of team based development as this is mostly the context we find ourselves in.

Always give answers/guidance within the context of good architectural principles. eg. code should always be simple and maintainable

They learn a lot from seeing how you deal with not knowing something. If they only see you in a state of "totally knowing everything", they get discouraged because they aren't there yet. If they see you encounter a challenge, break it down, test/experiment, and try new things, that gives them hope, and insight into how they can face the unknown, and tackle it.

- Keep a repository of examples and put together a collection of metaphors that work for you in explaining foreign concepts such as: The DOM, event handling, selectors, jQuery, code structure, scope, variables, functions, http, AJAX)

- Add additional material that might be applied to their jobs.

- Session invites, I send them out 24 hours prior to the session. I have found that if I send them out any earlier than that, students tend to forget.

- Tough love, students are paying a good amount of money and it's our job to make sure that they dont' have to shell out more because they fell behind. Make sure you are clear with them that they are starting to fall behind and what they need to do to get back on track. Your students want to make you happy.

* Showing students how to work through a problem that you don't understand is extremely helpful. It's one thing to immediately spit out an answer, but it's a different matter when they see the mentor themselves not know an answer to a question or problem and work through it.

* Patience, patience, patience. We as teachers / mentors have the "curse of knowledge". It's easy to forget what it's like not to know something. Constantly trying to find new ways to explain things is an excellent exercise that solidifies our own knowledge as well as builds an arsenal of ways to teach different students the same subject.

Record yourself mentoring and watch it back. It's generally shocking, but you learn a lot about what you do well and badly.

Don't worry if you have a bad session - it happens. But after any bad session try to think about why it went badly, and what could have been done to change it.

Often as a mentor I find myself giving my students advice on being a freelancer, selling yourself, and really awesome SEO and online marketing blogs and websites to follow. I think it's equally as important to know how to market yourself as it is to be competent as a programmer.

This book is amazing for anyone involved in teaching or studying:
